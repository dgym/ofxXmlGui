# ofxXmlGui #
openframeworks-based gui with lots of interesting extensions like web-based clients and midi learning.

## Notes: ##

- It depends on ofxXmlSettings, so add that to your project too.
- When adding the addon source to your project, exclude the "ext" directory unless you need its functionality
- Be careful not to add this whole directory to your openframeworks project in XCode, the xcode files in the examples folder can break your project.
